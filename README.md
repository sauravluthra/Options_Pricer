# Options_Pricer

## Introduction

Saurav Luthra, Dec 2021

My goal is to calculate the price of options along a certain stock's option chain using the Black-Scholes Model and Binomial Tree Method, and eventually scrape real-time market data to compare real bid/ask prices to calculated prices. The stock whose options chain is modeled will be user selected, as well as the expiry date for the option chain.

I'm hoping this options pricer project will lead me to a more in-depth understanding of options pricing and volatility, as well as the technical tools needed to create an algorithmic trading strategy from scratch. This project will not account for transaction costs and will not be able to execute trades on its own (due to some external restrictions) however I hope to implement such features in the future.
